# üé¨ Movie Search Service Guide
<!-- CONFIDENCE_INLINE -->
> **Confidence Score:** 0.81 ‚Äî *(see scoring table at bottom for details)*


## üìå Purpose
This guide explains how the **Movie Search Service** works from a business perspective. It is written for non-technical stakeholders and avoids technical jargon. It describes the service‚Äôs role, how it processes requests, and how it connects with other systems.

---

## üîë Key Questions this answers
- How does the Movie Search Service work end-to-end?  
- What inputs does it take, and what outputs does it provide?  
- What other services or processes does it depend on?  
- Where does the movie data come from?  
- What are the known and unknown details of the service?  

---

## üèóÔ∏è Service Overview
The **Movie Search Service** allows users or systems to look up movie information. It is built from two main processes:

1. **moviesearch.module.Process**  
   - Acts as the entry point for search requests.  
   - Exposes a REST endpoint at **`/movies`** (method: Unknown).  
   - Handles incoming requests, manages flow, and returns structured results.  

2. **moviesearch.module.SearchOmdb**  
   - Connects to the external **OMDb API** (a public movie database).  
   - Executes the actual search against OMDb.  
   - Returns movie details back to the main process.

## üîÑ End-to-End Flow

| Step | Action | Input | Output |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | **Receive Search Request** | REST call to `/movies` (method: Unknown) | Request accepted |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **Forward to OMDb Search** | Search parameters (e.g., title, year) | Query sent to OMDb |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **OMDb API Lookup** | External API call | Raw movie data |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Process Results** | Raw OMDb response | Structured movie details |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | **Return Response** | Structured data | JSON/XML response to requester |

## üîó Interdependencies & Data Touchpoints
- **moviesearch.module.Process** depends on **moviesearch.module.SearchOmdb** to fetch movie data.  
- **moviesearch.module.SearchOmdb** depends on the **OMDb API** (external system).  
- Both processes include built-in error handling and logging for traceability.  
- Data flows:  
  - Input: Search criteria (title, year, etc.)  
  - Output: Movie details (title, year, ratings, etc.)  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known vs Unknown
- ‚úÖ Known:  
  - Endpoint `/movies` exists.  
  - OMDb API is the external data source.  
  - Two processes: `Process` (entry point) and `SearchOmdb` (external lookup).  

- ‚ùì Unknown:  
  - Exact HTTP method for `/movies` (likely `GET`, but not confirmed).  
  - Full response schema (depends on OMDb API).  
  - Authentication requirements (if any).

## ‚úÖ Summary
The **Movie Search Service** provides a structured way to search for movies. It accepts requests at `/movies`, forwards them to the OMDb API, processes the results, and returns structured movie data. It is a simple but critical integration point between internal systems and an external movie database.  

üëâ This service is best understood as a **broker**: it takes in a request, delegates the search to OMDb, and delivers the results back in a consistent format.

## Confidence & Evidence Rollup

!!! info "How to read these scores"
    - **parsed** ‚Äî base signal that the process was parsed at all (typically 0.5 when activities were found).
    - **known_types_coverage** ‚Äî fraction of activities recognized as known BW types (higher is better; low values mean many unknown/opaque steps).
    - **transition_integrity** ‚Äî 1.0 if all transitions link valid activities; lower means broken/missing links.
    - **role_coverage** ‚Äî evidence of key roles detected (interface.receive / invoke.process / data.jdbc / messaging.jms, etc.).
    - **evidence_strength** ‚Äî proportion of claims backed by concrete evidence (e.g., detected endpoints, JDBC targets).
    - **inferred_fraction** ‚Äî portion of the explanation based on hypotheses (higher = more guesswork).

    Examples:
    - High **known_types_coverage** (‚â• 0.7): process uses well-identified palette activities (HTTP/REST/JDBC/JMS/etc.).
    - Low **transition_integrity** (< 1.0): transitions reference non-existent steps (XML issues or partial parse).
    - Low **evidence_strength** (‚âà 0.0): few/no concrete endpoints, datastore names, or invocation targets detected.
    - Higher **inferred_fraction** (‚â• 0.5): explanation relies on educated guesses (scant evidence in source).
    - Overall score is the average of component scores, penalized by any low scores.
